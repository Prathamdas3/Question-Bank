# Question-Bank

**Question Bank** is a repository for my project which is done by our team. It is a project where we have a demo of my website which does the same job as the name suggests, it is a question bank for college students who require previous year questions for their upcomming exams.

# Problems

As it is a demo project so many pages are under construction, For the lack of our knowledge there are bugs in this project

1. One of the bugs which we have recognized is "positioning issue for this problem different zoom labels see the page differently".

   - **To solve this please set the page according to your liking**

2. We don't have good UI too.
3. Due to our lack of knowledge on college exams and other things, for this many of the filters are still empty.
