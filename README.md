# Question-Bank

**Question Bank** is a repository for my project which is done by our team. It is a project where we have a demo of my website which does the same job as the name suggests, it is a question bank for college students who require previous year questions for their upcomming exams. In this project there are features to read questions and give practice tests too on several topics. It serves as a complete guide to get ready for any exam.

_"To view the actual website please click on the green coloured **CODE** button at right hand top portion. From there please download the zip file. A zip file named **Question-Bank-master** will be donloaded. After downloading please unzip it and open the Question-Bank-master folder.

# Problems

As it is a rough project so many pages are under construction. Because of our limited knowledge there are some bugs in this project. Some are:

1. One of the bugs which we have recognized is that each page at each zoom percentage works differently and all the contents of it are not shown properly. There is some positoning issue of the tabs as the move away to an inappropriate position when they are at different zoom levels. So presently you need to zoom accordingly to see all the contents of the website.
2. We don't have good UI too.
3. Due to our lack of knowledge in college exams and other things. For this reason many of the filters are still empty.
4. We still don't have the database of all questions or any previous year question papers and any solution of it, which is very much required. And the sample questions and answers needs to be updated with the actual ones.

                                       --THANK YOU, HOPE THE JUDGES WILL LIKE OUR PROJECT--
